# FAQ

## What is this site?

This is a lyrics site for metal songs I like (for now ðŸ˜‰). 

## How is this different for all YouTube videos that already have lyrics?

The videos you'll find here are embedded from the official YouTube accounts of
the artist or the record label of the content.

That means every reproduction or view counts directly to the owner.

This also means that the lyrics are not hardcode on the videos, they are just
floating over it. But hey, these are the official videos of every song plus
lyrics and most of the videos have lyrics in Spanish/video Language.

And yeah, there are plenty of original videos (or just the song) uploaded to
YouTube by users with hardcode lyrics but this is different because I'll try to
style the lyrics using the best fonts, colors, and animations for karaokes I
could find.

## Why the lyrics are not displayed in the correct position on my phone?

That's the way it is, for now, YouTube applies some calculations for the size
and position of the video with lower resolutions like phones, use your PC for a
better experience. Eventually, this will be fixed.

## If I find some kind of error, I have a suggestion or the lyrics are wrong, what should I do?

DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/byoigres),  I'll try to respond as soon
as possible.

## Can you please add the lyrics for this song?

Probably no, it's a lot of work to make these subtitles but hey, if you can
create one share it with me know, I'll give you credit. ðŸ™‚
