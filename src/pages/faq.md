# FAQ

## What is this site?

This is a lyrics site for metal songs I like (for now ðŸ˜‰). 

## How is this different for all YouTube videos that already have lyrics?

The videos you'll find here are embedded videos from the official YouTube
accounts of the artist or the record label of the content.

That means every reproduction or view counts directly to the owner of the
content.

This also means that the lyrics are not hardcode on the videos, they are just
floating over it. But hey, these are the official videos of every song plus
lyrics!

And yeah, there are plenty of original videos (or just the song) uploaded by
users with hardcode lyrics but this is different because I'll try to style the
lyrics using the best fonts, colors, and animations of karaokes I could find.

## Why the lyrics are displaying weird on my phone?

That's the way it is... for now, use your PC. I aware of that and I'll fix it
soon.

## I find some kind of error, what should I do?

Tell me about it.

## Can you please add the lyrics for this song?

No.

## Do you have a question?

DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/byoigres), I'll try to response as soon as possible.
