But hey, these are the official videos of every song plus\nlyrics and most of the videos have lyrics in Spanish/video Language.</p>\n<p>And yeah, there are plenty of original videos (or just the song) uploaded to\nYouTube by users with hardcode lyrics but this is different because I'll try to\nstyle the lyrics using the best fonts, colors, and animations for karaokes I\ncould find.</p>\n<h2>Why the lyrics are not displayed in the correct position on my phone?</h2>\n<p>That's the way it is, for now, YouTube applies some calculations for the size\nand position of the video with lower resolutions like phones, use your PC for a\nbetter experience. Eventually, this will be fixed.</p>\n<h2>If I find some kind of error, I have a suggestion or the lyrics are wrong, what should I do?</h2>\n<p>DM me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/byoigres\">Twitter</a>,  I'll try to respond as soon\nas possible.</p>\n<h2>Can you please add the lyrics for this song?</h2>\n<p>Probably no, it's a lot of work to make these subtitles but hey, if you can\ncreate one share it with me know, I'll give you credit. ðŸ™‚</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
