But hey, these are the official videos of every song plus\nlyrics!</p>\n<p>And yeah, there are plenty of original videos (or just the song) uploaded by\nusers with hardcode lyrics but this is different because I'll try to style the\nlyrics using the best fonts, colors, and animations of karaokes I could find.</p>\n<h2>Why the lyrics are displaying weird on my phone?</h2>\n<p>That's the way it is... for now, use your PC. I aware of that and I'll fix it\nsoon.</p>\n<h2>I find some kind of error, what should I do?</h2>\n<p>Tell me about it.</p>\n<h2>Can you please add the lyrics for this song?</h2>\n<p>No.</p>\n<h2>Do you have a question?</h2>\n<p>DM me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/byoigres\">twitter</a>, I'll try to response as soon as possible.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
